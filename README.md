# ExploreBrunel

Welcome to our GitHub repository

There are 6 students who are building the Explore Brunel App:
- Emmanuel Amankwah
- Kevin Doan
- Sahal Hassan
- Talha Sabir
- Hasnain Valli
- Maedin Zekarias

The application we are trying to create is to help potential students and students and staff to navigate around the campus. The application will be able to see buildings (with the history) , a map (that will be able to use locations) and the ability to change settings internally (setting themes, etc). The application is based on exploring brunel, its history and the current location of the user at Brunel University London
